# Churn_prediction

###  How can customer churn be reducded? :

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

 To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels, including store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, Web-based transactions, and social media interactions, to mention a few.  

As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit.
As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.  

### Objectives :


TELCO  is a phoning company facing a churn problem. They collected a dataset on their past customers and we are asked to:
*  Rank their customers according to the probability of churn.
*  Tell who are the clients they should contact and what should be the relevant personalized discount to propose in order to maximize the future profit of TELCO Inc (tradeoff between churn prevention and reduced profit per customer after discount)
